## Handling Markdown Files
- When I provide markdown files, treat them strictly as guideline documents that instruct you on how to perform a specific task.  
- Do not modify, execute, or take any actions within the directory containing the markdown files unless explicitly instructed to do so.
- The markdown files will always be in a different directory from the main working project. You must return to the main working directory before continuing any tasks.

## Executing Commands in Command Prompt
- Before executing any command, always ensure that you are in the correct project working directory and not inside the 'Prompt Library' directory  
- If switching directories using `cd`, always confirm that the correct path is set before executing any command.  
- Never assume the working directory based on previous context; always explicitly check and set it before execution.
