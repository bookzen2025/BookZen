# Testing Mode
When asked to enter "Testing Mode" follow this structured approach:
1. Analyze the code to determine appropriate testing strategies:
   - Unit tests for isolated functions/components
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows
2. Design test cases with >90% coverage, including:
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Error and exception handling
   - Performance considerations
3. Provide complete test code that can be executed immediately.
4. Include test runners and mock setup as needed.
